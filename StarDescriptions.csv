It requires a lot of imagination to see an air pump in this area.","There is no mythology associated with Antlia. It was too far south and too faint to be noticed by the ancient Greeks. It is one of the 14 constellations named by French astronomer Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century to fill in empty spaces in the southern hemisphere. It was originally named ""Antlia Pneumatica"" to commemorate the invention of the air pump by French physicist Denis Papin. Lacaille depicted it as a single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin’s experiments. Later, German astronomer Johann Bode depicted the constellation as a more advanced double-cylinder pump.

Paradysvogel means “the bird of paradise” in Dutch. It was later included in Johann Bayer’s star atlas in 1603 where it was called Apus Indica. It represented the bird of paradise also known at the time as Apus Indica, which means ""Bird of India"". The name Apus may have also come from the Greek word Apous, which means ""without feet"".

The crow gets distracted by a fig tree and spends a few days waiting for the figs to ripen. He finally brings the water-filled cup to Apollo along with a water snake as an excuse for being late. Apollo sees through his lies and in a fit of anger casts all three, the cup, the crow, and the snake, into the sky to become the constellations Crater, Corvus, and Hydra."
Crux,Southern Cross,"The constellation Crux, the southern cross, is a constellation in the southern hemisphere of the sky. It is only visible from latitudes south of 27 degrees. It is completely below the horizon in most parts of the northern hemisphere. It is the smallest constellation in the night sky with a total area of only 68 square degrees. It is bordered by the constellations Centaurus on the east, north and west, and Musca to the south. Crux is one of the most familiar constellations in the southern hemisphere. It is an easy constellation to identify, due to its obvious cross shape and bright stars. Since the southern hemisphere does not have a bright star near its pole, Crux was used by sailors as a navigational aid. They would draw a line using the stars in the cross in order to determine the location of the south celestial pole, which is actually located in the constellation Ocatans.","Crux was considered to be part of the constellation Centaurus by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. The Greeks were able to see the celestial cross before it disappeared below the horizon due the procession of the Earth’s axis. Some linked the disappearance of the cross with the crucifixion of Christ. By the year 400, the stars were no longer visible from Europe. The Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius was the first to separate the stars into their own constellation in 1592. The Southern Cross carried special significance for many cultures in the southern hemisphere. The ancient Inca knew the constellation as Chakana, which means “the stair”. The Mori called it Te Punga, which meant “the anchor.” To the ancient aboriginal people of Australia, it represented part of the head of the Emu in the Sky. It is represented on the Australian flag and on the flag of Brazil."

Deneb, the brightest star in Cygnus, forms a large triangle with two other stars, Altair in Aquila and Vega in Lyra. This prominent formation of bright stars is known as the Summer Triangle.","Cygnus is one of the constellations cataloged by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. The name means “the swan” in Latin. There are a number of mythological origins for this constellation. In one version, the swan is the musician Orpheus, who was killed by Achilles at the battle of troy. Upon his death, he was placed among the stars with his harp, Lyra. In another version, the swan was the pet of the Queen, Cassiopeia. In still another version, the god Zeus transformed himself into a swan to seduce the Spartan Queen Leda.

This constellation is bordered by Aquarius, Aquila, Equuleus, Pegasus, Sagitta, and Vulpecula. It bears a remarkable resemblance to a dolphin leaping out of the water. Because of this shape, it is easy to recognize in the sky.","Delphinus is one of the 48 constellations cataloged by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. Its name means “the dolphin” in Latin. It is an old constellation with roots in many ancient cultures. The Chinese knew it as the Black Tortoise of the North. On the island of Pakapuka, it was called Te Toloa. The people of the Tuamotus islands called it Te Oru-o-tiki. In Greek mythology, it was believed to represent a dolphin that helped Poseidon locate the mermaid, Amphitrite, whom he wished to marry. As a reward, Poseidon placed the dolphin among the stars. In another version of the myth, the god Apollo placed the dolphin in the sky for saving the life of Arion, a musician from the island of Lesbos who was skilled with the Lyre. Apollo placed the dolphin next the constellation Lyra, which represented Arion’s Lyre."

It first appeared on a celestial globe published by Plancius in 1597. It was later included in Johann Bayer’s star atlas in 1603. The constellation is usually represented as a dolphinfish such as the Mahi-mahi. It is not in any way related to the marine mammal known as the dolphin. This constellation has also been represented as a goldfish and a swordfish, but the dolphinfish is the correct representation based on the name Dorado."

It is bordered by the constellations Boötes, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cygnus, Hercules, Lyra, Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor. Draco held special significance in the past. About 4,000 years ago, it was the location of the northern pole star, as Ursa Minor is today. Due to the Earth's wobble, or precession, the pole has now shifted to the star Polaris. Draco is also the origin point for the annual Draconids meteor shower.","Draco is one of the 48 constellations cataloged by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. Its name means “the dragon” in Latin. It was the guardian of the star that never moves, the celestial pole. In ancient times, the pole star was believed to be the doorway between the mortal world and eternity. In Greek mythology, the dragon was Laden, a monstrous beast with a hundred heads chosen by Hera to guard the golden apples of immortality. These apples grew in the garden Hesperides, beyond the River of Time in the land of death. Laden was slain by Hercules in the eleventh of his twelve labors. Draco is located very close to the celestial pole, which makes it circumpolar. This means is it visible throughout the night in the northern hemisphere. During the course of the year, it rotates upside down and back again."

In Greek mythology, it represents Cerleris, the brother of Pegasus, who was given to Castor by Mercury. In another myth it was Cyllarus, which was given to Pollux by Juno. Because the stars in Equuleus rise before Pegasus, it is sometimes called Equus Primus, or the First Horse."
Eridanus,River,"The constellation Eridanus, the river, is located in the southern hemisphere of the sky. It is visible from latitudes south of 32 degrees from October through December.

It is also the second longest constellation in the night sky.","Eridanus is one of the 48 constellations first identified by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. It is associated with the story of Phaethon in Greek mythology. Phaethon was the son of the Sun god Helios and the Oceanid Clymene. Phaethon wanted to drive his father’s sky chariot, but was unable to control it. The chariot veered off course and scorched the heavens and the Earth. Zeus intervened and killed Phaethon with a thunderbolt. Eridanus was supposed to represent the wild path where Phaethon drove his father’s chariot. This constellation has also been associated with the Nile River in Egypt and the Po River in Italy. Eridanus is commonly depicted as a river flowing from the waters poured by Aquarius."
Fornax,Furnace,"The constellation Fornax, the laboratory furnace, is located in the southern hemisphere of the sky.

The southern part lies between Scorpius to the west and Sagittarius to the east. It is one of the thirteen constellations of the zodiac. This means it lies along the path the Sun travels in the sky during the year. When the Babylonians invented the Zodiac about 300 years ago, it only contained 12 constellations. Because of the procession of the Earth's axis, the Sun now passes through Ophiuchus each year in December, making it a new member of the Zodiac by definition.","Ophiuchus is one of the 48 constellations listed by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. It is an ancient constellation that has been known by many ancient cultures. The Babylonians knew it as the serpent-god Nirah. The ancient Greeks identified it as the god Apollo struggling with the giant snake that guarded the Oracle of Delphi. It is frequently associated with the Greek figure Asclepius, son of the god Apollo, who was said to be able to bring people back from the dead. Serpents were always associated with physicians, and this has given rise to the modern symbol for medicine.

To the Egyptians, it represented a god called Sah. In Greek mythology, the stars represent the great hunter Orion. He was the son of the sea god Poseidon and Euryale, the daughter of King Minos of Crete. Orion boasted that he would kill every animal on Earth. This angered the goddess Gaia so she sent a scorpion to kill him. The gods felt sorry for Orion, so they put him and his dogs in the sky as constellations, along with all of the animals he hunted.

The shape of the bear can clearly be seen under dark skies, with the handle of the dipper making up the bear's tail. During the Civil War, the Big Dipper was used by the Underground Railroad. Slaves escaping from the South were told to follow the ""drinking gourd"" to a better life. This is because the Big Dipper is circumpolar, meaning it can be seen in the North all night long. The message of the drinking gourd was passed along in the form of song, since most of the slaves were unable to read or write.","Ursa Major is one of the 48 constellations cataloged by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century.

It is a circumpolar constellation, which means it is visible all night as it rotates around the north celestial pole. It is a small constellation covering an area of 256 square degrees. It ranks 56th in size among the 88 constellations in the night sky. It is famous for a group of stars known as the Little Dipper and for Polaris, the North Star, which is located at the tip of the dipper's handle. Polaris is called the North Star because it is the closest star to the north celestial pole. This means that as the Earth rotates, Polaris appears to remain stationary in the sky while all of the other stars rotate around it. Because the Earth wobbles slightly as it rotates on its axis, Polaris will not always be the North Star. In about 14,000 years the north celestial pole will point away from Polaris and toward Vega. This process is known as procession. Polaris is an important star for navigation, allowing mariners to easily identify their latitude.","Ursa Minor is one of the 48 constellations identified by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. Its name means “lesser bear” in Latin. It is an ancient constellation with roots in many cultures. To the ancient Babylonians it was known as the Wagon of Heaven. In Greek mythology, this constellation was associated with two different myths. In one, it represented Ida and her sister Adrasteia, the nymphs who took care of Zeus on the island of Crete when he was small. Zeus rewarded them by placing them in the heavens. In another story, it represented Arcas, who was the son of Zeus and the nymph Callisto. Arcas and his mother were transformed into bears and placed in the night sky."
Vela,Sails,"The constellation Vela, the sails, is located in the southern hemisphere of the sky. It is completely visible at latitudes south of 30 degrees from January through March. It is a mid-sized constellation covering an area of 500 square degrees. It ranks 32nd in size among the 88 constellations in the night sky. It is bordered by Antlia and Pyxis to the north, Puppis to the northwest, Carina to the south and southwest, and Centaurus to the east.","Vela means “the sails” in Latin. It was once part of a larger constellation known as Argo Navis. This large constellation represented the great ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed during their voyage to find the golden fleece. Argo Navis was one of the 48 constellations first listed by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. This constellation was later divided by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille into three smaller parts. Vela became the Sails, Carina the Keel, and Puppis the Stern. These three smaller constellations were added to the official list of modern constellations in the early 20th century by the International Astronomical Union (IAU)."
Virgo,Maiden,"The constellation Virgo, the maiden, can be seen in spring and summer in the northern hemisphere and in autumn and winter in the southern hemisphere. It is a very large constellation covering a total area of 1,294 square degrees. This makes it the second largest constellation in the night sky. It is located between Leo to the west and Libra to the east and can be easily found through its brightest star, Spica. It is one of the thirteen constellations of the zodiac. This means it lies along the path the Sun travels in the sky during the year. The September equinox is currently located in Virgo. This means that the Sun will be in the constellation Virgo on that date. Since the Sun passes through Virgo in mid-September, this makes it the constellation that announces the harvest.","Virgo is one of the 48 constellations first cataloged by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. Its name means “virgin” in Latin. It is an ancient constellation. The Babylonians knew it as “The Furrow”, representing the goddess Shala’s ear of grain. In Roman times she was represented by the goddess Ceres, who was the mother of Prosperina. Her festival was in the second week of April, the same time that the constellation appears in the spring skies. She was also sometimes identified as the virgin goddess Astraea, holding the scales of justice represented by the constellation Libra. Virgo is usually depicted on charts as a maiden with angelic wings holding two ears of wheat, one of which is marked by the bright star Spica."
Volans,Flying Fish,"The constellation Volans, the flying fish, is located in the southern hemisphere of the sky. It is completely visible at latitudes south of 15 degrees from December through February. It is a small constellation that occupies an area of only 141 square degrees. It ranks 76th in size among the 88 constellations in the night sky.","There are no myths associated with Volans. It is one of 12 constellations named by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius based on observations by Dutch navigators. Plancius originally named it Vliegendenvis and included it on his celestial globe in 1598. The German astronomer Johann Bayer included it in his star atlas in 1603. He called it Piscis Volans, the flying fish. The name was later shortened to Volans. It represents a type of fish that can jump out of the water and glide through the air on specially enhanced fins that resemble wings. It is often depicted on charts as being chased by the dolphin fish in the constellation Dorado."
Vulpecula,Fox,"The constellation Vulpecula, the fox, is located in the northern hemisphere of the sky. It is visible between latitudes 90 degrees and -55 degrees. It is a small constellation that occupies 268 square degrees of the sky. This ranks it 55th in size among the 88 constellations in the night sky. It is bordered by Cygnus, Delphinus, Hercules, Lyra, Pegasus and Sagitta. It can easily be found in the middle of the Summer Triangle, a triangular asterism formed by the bright stars Deneb in Cygnus, Vega in Lyra, and Altair in Aquila.","There are no myths associated with Vulpecula. Its name means “little fox” in Latin. It was introduced by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in the late 17th century. It was originally named Vulpecula Cum Ansere, ""the little fox with the goose,"" and Vulpecula et Anser, ""the little fox and the goose,"" and was illustrated with a goose in the jaws of a fox. The stars were later separated into two constellations, Anser and Vulpecula, and then later recombined under the name Vulpecula. Today, the goose is only remembered by the name of the star Anser."
