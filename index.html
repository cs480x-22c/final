                Anyone who steps outside on a clear night can see the stars, but not everyone 
                knows which stars to connect to form constellations. Even fewer are aware of the 
                history surrounding constellations, some of which date back to ancient Greece. In 
                this project we developed an interactive visualization that presents the constellations
                and their stories. Using a dataset we created by scraping and combining information from 
                multiple sources, we leveraged JavaScript and d3-geo-projection to create the visualization.
                The constellations are initially hidden, and you can mouse over the star maps to reveal them or 
                view a specific one by selecting a name in the side panel. Once you reveal all the 
                constellations, you'll be well on your way to understanding the stories in our stars!
