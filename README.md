Final Project - Interactive Data Visualization  
===

Hello! This is our project for the final project. It is a website dedicated to the alien abduction data we found online. To make this possible, we created several different displays based on the various types of data given to let us show off our D3 skills we learned from the class. 

While creating our project, we drew on libraries such as JSON. We also made use of multiple different font libraries in order to create an out of this world theme on our wbesite.

When browsing our site, you may scroll down to view multiple visualizations of UFO data nationwide, to give full insight about the data we recieved from the NUFORC website.

As you scroll, the final two graphs are interactive representations of overall abduction reports nationwide as well as the frequency of abductions per year, hosted on Tableau live. The first three graphs were created using D3, and display information about each visualization when moused over.

Our website, process book, and screencast are included below.

Final Project Materials
---
### Process Book



### Project Screen-Cast

Each team will create a two minute screen-cast with narration showing a demo of your visualization and/or some slides. 

You can use any screencast tool of your choice, such as Camtasia or Loom (new and recommended). 
Please make sure that the sound quality of your video is good -- it may be worthwhile to invest in an external USB microphone-- campus IT should have some you can borrow. 
Upload the video to an online video-platform such as YouTube or Vimeo and embed it into your project web page. 
For our final project presentation day, we will show as many videos in class as possible, and ask teams to field questions.

We will strictly enforce the two minute time limit for the video, so please make sure you are not running longer. 
Use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across. Focus the majority of your screencast on your main contributions rather than on technical details. 
What do you feel is the best part of your project? 
What insights did you gain? 
What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away? Make sure it is front and center rather than at the end.


Grading
---

- Process Book - Are you following a design process that is well documented in your process book?
- Solution - Is your visualization effective in answering your intended questions? Was it designed following visualization principles?
- Implementation - What is the quality of your implementation? Is it appropriately polished, robust, and reliable?
- Presentation - Are your web site and screencast clear, engaging, and effective?
Your individual project score will also be influenced by your peer evaluations.
