CS480X Final Project - Artiic Ice Cracks Analysis
===

Summary
---

For our final revised project proposal we wanted to look into how over the years how the arctic ice has evolved during recent years. As you see in the figure the red circles shows the arctic circle which is the area we focused all of our data on. Doing this project was very interesting for all of us to do since we all wanted to a data visualization on the worldwide perspective. The preprocessing of all of the data took us a while to get down and so did all of the d3.js plotting of the data. 

The main reasoning for the project is that we wanted to look into how pollution may affect the arctic ice in which it does in several different ways over the years. Once we got all of our data and we knew how to execute the final goal it got much better. Since we spent a lot of time looking at and preprocessing different datasets which took a long time.
