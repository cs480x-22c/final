Our group made an interactive 25live calendar and map

Our submission includes our index.html file which renders our actual application, the index.css file which is our styling guide, the renderCalendar.js file which renders our calendar, the renderMap.js file which renders our map, our process book, our filtered 25 live csv which only includes events open to all students, the map.geojson file, and the whole 25live dataset.
