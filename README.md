Final Project - Interactive Data Visualization  
===

Hello! This is our project for the final project. It is a website dedicated to the alien abduction data we found online. To make this possible, we created several different displays based on the various types of data given to let us show off our D3 skills we learned from the class. 

While creating our project, we drew on libraries such as JSON. We also made use of multiple different font libraries in order to create an out of this world theme on our wbesite.

When browsing our site, you may scroll down to view multiple visualizations of UFO data nationwide, to give full insight about the data we recieved from the NUFORC website.

As you scroll, the final two graphs are interactive representations of overall abduction reports nationwide as well as the frequency of abductions per year, hosted on Tableau live. The first three graphs were created using D3, and display information about each visualization when moused over.

Our website, process book, and screencast are included below.
