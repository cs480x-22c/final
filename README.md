I created this using D3.js, CSVToTable from vividvilla, Webflow for a basic HTML website, and Sean Lahman's Baseball Statistics database which I downloaded as .csv files.

My project visualizes comparisons between different baseball statistics and years. You are able to search for any player from from 1871 to 2020
and can filter players based on number of at bats. Clicking on a player will highlight them, and you can click again to move them off the plot.
