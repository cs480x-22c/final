Data Visualization Final Project - Spotify's Top Tracks and Popularity
===
Mattheus Faria and Kristi Prifti

Overview
---

Spotify is one of, if not the most popular music streaming service used today. What many people donâ€™t know is that Spotify has strangely specific data on each song uploaded to its platform. Numerical values ranging from how danceable a song is to how happy the tone of the song is.

We want to use this data on the top tracks throughout recent years in order to answer questions on what makes a song popular.

All files in this repository are original except for the Gotham Bold Regular font file
